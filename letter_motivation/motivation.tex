I am writing to express my strong interest in the position of \textbf{Data Science Expert} at ETH Zurich’s Scientific IT Services (SIS), as advertised. As a PhD graduate in Mathematics from the University of Zurich, with a robust background in programming, data analysis, and computational science, I am excited about the opportunity to use my expertise in supporting ETH researchers comb through data and contributing to the institution’s mission of excellence in research, teaching, and innovation.

I have a deep connection with ETH Zurich, having been a master's student at the university. The opportunity to return to Zurich, and contribute to the institution that played a pivotal role in my academic development, is both exciting and meaningful. ETH Zurich has instilled in me a drive for relevance and excellence, and I see this role as a unique opportunity to give back by helping shape future research with cutting-edge data science solutions.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have consistently demonstrated excellence in mathematics, programming, and problem-solving. As a grantee of the Swiss National Science Foundation, I had the privilege of collaborating with renowned mathematicians, furthering my analytical and communication skills. My industrial experience as a Data Analyst has allowed me to develop solutions that enable data-driven decision-making, modernizing approaches within an industrial environment. This balance between academic rigor and real-world application is something I value highly and is reflected in my work philosophy.

My technical experience aligns well with the requirements of the \textbf{Data Science Expert} role. I have extensive experience in Python, having developed packages for published work in mathematics, and used it for industry applications as well as competitions and Olympiads. I have also contributed to the MATHRepo project during my time at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Leipzig, a project that sought to capture and manage mathematical data. This experience, alongside my work on data-driven decision-making in industry, has provided me with a broad perspective on data management, analysis, and software development—core aspects of this role.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong foundation in scientific computing and statistical methods, as well as experience working with diverse stakeholders on complex data science projects, using tools like pytorch. I am proficient in Unix/Linux environments: regularly work with Ubuntu and Debian, use git in my work and have a deep understanding of the software development stack for Windows applications.

The opportunity to support ETH researchers in a collaborative environment and working with experts from diverse fields, aligns perfectly with my passion for interdisciplinary research and scientific computing. I am particularly drawn to the autonomy and project ownership that this role offers, as well as the chance to engage in the larger data science community at ETH Zurich. 

\vspace{3cm}

I am confident that my skills, combined with my strong communication and project management abilities, will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the Computational and Data Science Support group at ETH.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to discuss how my experience and vision can contribute to ETH Zurich’s Scientific IT Services. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications.
